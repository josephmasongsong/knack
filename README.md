# README

This is the front end for the Knackworks website.

https://www.knackworks.ca

It uses Locomotive CMS and specifically it's Wagon templating engine. All docs here: https://locomotive-v3.readme.io/v3.4/docs/quick-start

For future developers:

* You should be comfortable with the Liquid templating language

* You should have Ruby installed on your system and be comfortable using the command line

* If you know both, you got this ;)
